## PH 142 Textbook [TODO: Come up with a better name for the textbook]

Plan: Use Data 8's [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/) ([Repo](https://github.com/data-8/textbook)) as a template to set up PH 142 Textbook

Future steps:
- Lay out different chapters / content for each page
- Convert Corinne / Mi-Suk PDFs to .ipynb/.md format
